rec266|Insulin is the preferred medication for treating hyperglycemia in gestational diabetes mellitus, as it does not cross the placenta to a measurable extent. Metformin and glyburide may be used, but both cross the placenta to the fetus, with metformin likely crossing to a greater extent than glyburide. All oral agents lack long-term safety data.

rec267|Metformin, when used to treat polycystic ovary syndrome and induce ovulation, need not be continued once pregnancy has been confirmed. A|Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy|[rec267](https://github.com/johnnybender/adastandards2017/blob/master/recommendations/rec267.md)
rec268|Potentially teratogenic medications (ACE inhibitors, statins, etc.) should be avoided in sexually active women of childbearing age who are not using reliable contraception. B|Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy|[rec268](https://github.com/johnnybender/adastandards2017/blob/master/recommendations/rec268.md)
rec269|Fasting and postprandial self-monitoring of blood glucose are recommended in both gestational diabetes mellitus and preexisting diabetes in pregnancy to achieve glycemic control. Some women with preexisting diabetes should also test blood glucose preprandially. B|Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy|[rec269](https://github.com/johnnybender/adastandards2017/blob/master/recommendations/rec269.md)
rec270|Due to increased red blood cell turnover, A1C is lower in normal pregnancy than in normal nonpregnant women. The A1C target in pregnancy is 6–6.5% (42–48 mmol/mol); <6% (42 mmol/mol) may be optimal if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia, but the target may be relaxed to <7% (53 mmol/mol) if necessary to prevent hypoglycemia. B|Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy|[rec270](https://github.com/johnnybender/adastandards2017/blob/master/recommendations/rec270.md)
rec271|In pregnant patients with diabetes and chronic hypertension, blood pressure targets of 120–160/80–105 mmHg are suggested in the interest of optimizing long-term maternal health and minimizing impaired fetal growth. E|Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy|[rec271](https://github.com/johnnybender/adastandards2017/blob/master/recommendations/rec271.md)
rec272|Perform an A1C for all patients with diabetes or hyperglycemia admitted to the hospital if not performed in the prior 3 months. B|Diabetes Care in the Hospital|[rec272](https://github.com/johnnybender/adastandards2017/blob/master/recommendations/rec272.md)
rec273|Insulin therapy should be initiated for treatment of persistent hyperglycemia starting at a threshold ≥180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L). Once insulin therapy is started, a target glucose range of 140–180 mg/dL (7.8–10.0 mmol/L) is recommended for the majority of critically ill patients A and noncritically ill patients. C|Diabetes Care in the Hospital|[rec273](https://github.com/johnnybender/adastandards2017/blob/master/recommendations/rec273.md)
rec274|More stringent goals, such as <140 mg/dL (<7.8 mmol/L), may be appropriate for selected patients, as long as this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia. C|Diabetes Care in the Hospital|[rec274](https://github.com/johnnybender/adastandards2017/blob/master/recommendations/rec274.md)
rec275|Intravenous insulin infusions should be administered using validated written or computerized protocols that allow for predefined adjustments in the insulin infusion rate based on glycemic fluctuations and insulin dose. E|Diabetes Care in the Hospital|[rec275](https://github.com/johnnybender/adastandards2017/blob/master/recommendations/rec275.md)
rec276|Basal insulin or a basal plus bolus correction insulin regimen is the preferred treatment for noncritically ill patients with poor oral intake or those who are taking nothing by mouth. An insulin regimen with basal, nutritional, and correction components is the preferred treatment for noncritically ill hospitalized patients with good nutritional intake. A|Diabetes Care in the Hospital|[rec276](https://github.com/johnnybender/adastandards2017/blob/master/recommendations/rec276.md)
rec277|Sole use of sliding scale insulin in the inpatient hospital setting is strongly discouraged. A|Diabetes Care in the Hospital|[rec277](https://github.com/johnnybender/adastandards2017/blob/master/recommendations/rec277.md)
rec278|A hypoglycemia management protocol should be adopted and implemented by each hospital or hospital system. A plan for preventing and treating hypoglycemia should be established for each patient. Episodes of hypoglycemia in the hospital should be documented in the medical record and tracked. E|Diabetes Care in the Hospital|[rec278](https://github.com/johnnybender/adastandards2017/blob/master/recommendations/rec278.md)
rec279|The treatment regimen should be reviewed and changed as necessary to prevent further hypoglycemia when a blood glucose value is <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). C|Diabetes Care in the Hospital|[rec279](https://github.com/johnnybender/adastandards2017/blob/master/recommendations/rec279.md)
rec280|There should be a structured discharge plan tailored to the individual patient with diabetes. B|Diabetes Care in the Hospital|[rec280](https://github.com/johnnybender/adastandards2017/blob/master/recommendations/rec280.md)
